   1. GETTING STARTED -

       In order for a search to be done, you must set the source file(s). The source
   file(s)is a file (or files) that the eXtreme Team Search program will investigate 
   in order to find whatever it is you are looking for. You can either use the "File" 
   tab in menu bar or the buttons at the bottom of the screen to start setting up your 
   source file(s). 
    
        - Add Files -
            This option will open a menu to help you locate the file(s) you wish to
        use as your search source. You can add as many files as you wish, but be 
        aware the "Search ANY Term" may only bring up one of the files if found.

        - Remove Files -
            This task will remove any file(s) from the search option. If you added
        a file by mistake, or wish to exclude it, you can remove it as a source.

        - View Files -
            If you wish to view what source(s) you have for a search, you can click
        the "View Files" button. This will bring up a menu that will show you what
        your current source(s) are for the search.

        - Update Files -
            By clicking this button, you will update any file(s) you may have edited.
        This will help make your file(s) current to use for the search.



   2. USING THE SEARCH -

       You can use the Search Menu to search your computer for any files you wish.
   Please enter the name of the file you wish to get and select search. Now be aware
   that each search function will bring up different items. Please, be aware you MUST 
   locate a source for the search first, which will be listed under the "GETTING STARTED"
   section.

        - Search ANY Term -
            This option will look at files names individually. For example, the
        search option "run all night" Will look for "run", "all", "night" whenever 
        they are found, together in one word or not. So this can bring up the file
        "run in the morning", "all the people of the world", "Silent Night". It is
        also possible if you use multiple files, this option will ONLY locate the
        word in one of the files, not both.

        - Search ALL Terms -
            This option will look at files in which has all the words within it.
        For example, "run all night" will locate only the files that has all three
        files in it; however, it can be in any order like "the night all people run".
        With this option, the search will locate ANY word in ANY files, recording 
        all files it is found in. This option is best used if you wish to see all
        the results in any file, as opposed to just one file.

        - Search Exact Phrase - 
            This option will look for the exact phrase in that order. So, "run all
        night" will produce only files that has "run all night" in it in that exact 
        order. This option should be used for exact searches.

       *By clicking the "search" button, your computer will begin it's search for the
   file*

        - Clear Fields -
            This will clear the current items in the search bar for a clear erase.
        Please do not be confused with the "Remove Files" button. This will not 
        remove all files at once, but just a quick way to erase the search bar box.
